### Rules of the Game

Kraljevska igra pravila:
Najobicnije pravilo je da veca vrenost karte nosi manju vrednos
izvlace se po 5 karata po rundi i runda se zavrsava kada jedan o igraca nema vise karata u ruci

Pocinje posle bacanje kockice vece vrednost igrac bacio
Prvi igrac je napadac dok drugi igrac brani, yzatim nakon jednog napada igrads sto se ranio napada 
neki brojevi imaju posebne spodobnosti mogu se igrati kao durga karta (special cards)
Napadacna karta pa odbrana pa special card i ako taj ko brani ima special card i on moze da je odigra

Ako karta koja nosi kartu manjeg broja su istog znaka igrac koji je pokupio kartu moze izvuci jednu kartu iz svog spila
primer: svaki pobednik iz borbe istog znaka vuce 1 kartu sa svog spila

ako su karte iste vredosti obe karte idu na groblje, 
postoje specijane karte koje omogucuju da se random karta pokupi iz groblja i stavi na brojmu gomilu

brojna gomila su karte koje su igraci pokupili sa stola svojim kartama vise vrednosit

brojna gomil je Count stack
