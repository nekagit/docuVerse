# Best Front-End Practices

## Load Front-End Resources Quickly
Front-end resources, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, should be optimized for fast loading. Minimize file sizes, utilize compression, and employ techniques like lazy loading to ensure the fastest possible loading times.

## Optimize Font Loading in Header
To expedite font rendering, consider loading essential fonts in the header directly. This prevents the browser from waiting for the external `stylesheet.css` file to load before rendering the text with the specified font.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Your+Font+Here&display=swap">
```

## Preconnect to Critical Third-Party Origins
Improve performance by preconnecting to critical third-party origins. This reduces latency by establishing the necessary connections early in the loading process.
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
```

## Use Self-Hosted Fonts
Consider self-hosting fonts to enhance control over loading times. This reduces reliance on external servers and allows for better optimization.
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'YourFont';
  src: url('/path/to/your/font.woff2') format('woff2');
  /* Add additional font formats and variations as needed */
}
```

## Limit Web Fonts
Minimize the number of web fonts used on a page. Each additional font increases page load time. Strike a balance between aesthetics and performance.

## Choose an Appropriate `font-display` Strategy
Select a suitable `font-display` strategy to control how the browser handles font rendering before it's fully loaded. This ensures a better user experience. For example:
```css
/* Fallback to system fonts if the custom font is not yet loaded */
font-family: 'YourFont', sans-serif;
font-display: swap;
```

Remember to adapt these practices based on your specific project requirements and design considerations.
