## Frist Steps
#### Prompt into ChatGpt

Generate a tutorial for how to implement a customized chatbot with LangChain, preferably using Vue; otherwise, using React with TypeScript, incorporating ChatGPT, and utilizing Python.
#### Results

Prerequisites:
1. Install Node.js and npm


#### Understanding 
Before diving into the implementation, familiarize yourself with some basic concepts:

Vue.js (or React with TypeScript): These are JavaScript frameworks used for building user interfaces. Vue.js is simpler, and React with TypeScript adds static typing for better code quality.
Python: A versatile programming language, suitable for server-side development.
API: It's a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. LangChain and ChatGPT will provide APIs that we can use in our project.


#### Set Up Your Project
Create a new project using Vue.js or React with TypeScript. This provides the foundation for your chatbot.

In your project, you'll need to install some tools to help with specific tasks:

Axios: A tool for making HTTP requests. In the command line, run npm install axios for Vue.js or npm install axios for React with TypeScript.
LangChain API (Optional): If LangChain provides an API, you might need to sign up and get credentials.

#### Plan Your Chatbot
Think about how you want your chatbot to work. What should it do? What kind of interactions should it support?

#### Set Up Python Server
Create a Python server using Flask (a web framework). This server will handle interactions with LangChain and ChatGPT. You can install Flask by running pip install Flask. Implement the logic to communicate with LangChain and fetch responses from ChatGPT.
