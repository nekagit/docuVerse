# **Understanding Electric Charge**

Electric charge is indeed a **fundamental concept** rooted in the subatomic level within the **atomic model**. An atom consists of **neutrons**, which are neutral, **protons**, which are **positively charged**, and **electrons**, which are **negatively charged**. The number of protons in the atom determines the atom's **elementary charge** and thus its positive charge.

# **Atomic Composition and Charge**

For example, **hydrogen** has one proton and one electron. **Oxygen** has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, and typically 8 electrons (in a neutral atom), but the number of electrons can vary, leading to **ion formation**.

# **Valence Electrons and Chemical Properties**

The charge of an individual atom is usually neutral since the number of protons equals the number of electrons. However, it's the electrons in the outermost shell of an atom that are responsible for **chemical reactions** and **electrical properties**. These electrons are referred to as **valence electrons**. The number of valence electrons determines the **chemical properties** of an element and its position in the **periodic table**.

# **Movement and Interaction of Charge**

The **separation** and **recombination** of charge depend on the movement of these electrons. When electrons flow from one atom to another, this can lead to separation or recombination of charges, observed in **electricity** or **chemical reactions**.

# **Universal Charged Particles**

There are also **universal particles**, each carrying a specific charge. The **electron** is an example of a **negatively charged particle**, while the **proton** is an example of a **positively charged particle**. These particles are not limited to specific elements but are **universal building blocks** of matter.

# **Conclusion: The Role of Charge in Matter**

In summary, the charge of an atom is determined by the number of protons present in its nucleus. The **electrical properties** of an element depend on the arrangement and number of electrons in the outer shells.
