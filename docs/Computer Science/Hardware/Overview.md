# Overview
**Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can touch and manipulate.

1. CPU / Central Processing Unit
2. RAM / Random Access Memory
3. SSD / Solid-State-Drivers
4. Input / Keyboards...
5. #Peripherals / Graphic Card, Sound Card, Network Adapter

**Hardware** is what enables a computer system to function and execute tasks, and it contrasts with software, which refers to the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
