**Importance of Line Height in Typography:** Good design involves appropriate line height, with the recommended range being 1.1 to 1.3 times the text size for headings and 1.3 to 1.5 times for body text. This improves readability and the overall aesthetic of the design.

**Letter Spacing Makes a Difference:** Adjusting the space between characters, known as letter spacing, can enhance the design. Negative letter spacing is suggested for headings to add a certain crispness but should be avoided for body text to maintain readability.

**Proper Text Alignment is Essential:** Avoid center-aligning long paragraphs, as it can slow down reading speed. For anything that spans more than three lines of text, left alignment is recommended. Also, avoid mixing alignments between headings and body text.

**Considerations for Text Width:** Based on a study by The Baymard Institute, long lines of text can overwhelm users, leading to less engagement and lower conversions. A good range to maintain is 50 to 75 characters for body text, with around 600 pixels width for a desktop screen.

**Hierarchy:** Avoid overusing text sizes to indicate hierarchy. Try to stick to two different font sizes, using font weight and color changes for hierarchy.

**Spacing:** Consider the space between text elements; elements with closer relationships should be positioned closer. Use multipliers to maintain consistent spacing between elements.

**Consistency in Font Usage:** Use consistent fonts throughout your design to maintain visual coherence. Avoid mixing too many different fonts as it can create a chaotic appearance.

**Contrast in Font Styles:** Incorporate contrast in font styles (e.g., bold, italic) to highlight important information and create visual interest. However, be cautious not to overuse contrasting styles, as it can lead to cluttered design.

**Whitespace Management:** Proper utilization of whitespace (empty space around elements) can enhance readability and visual appeal. Ensure adequate spacing between paragraphs, headings, and other elements to prevent overcrowding and allow content to breathe.

**Accessibility Considerations:** Pay attention to font size, color contrast, and text spacing to ensure your design is accessible to users with visual impairments. Following accessibility guidelines improves usability and inclusivity.

**Responsive Typography:** Design your typography to be responsive, ensuring it adjusts appropriately across different screen sizes and devices. Use relative units like ems or percentages for font sizes to maintain scalability.

# 10 Cheat Codes for Designing User Interfaces

## Cheat Codes for UI Design

| Cheat Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 1. | **Font Hierarchy** |
|    | - Font hierarchy involves a mix of size, weights, and colors to create contrast. |
|    | - Use bold and darker styles for primary content, lighter styles for secondary content. |
|    | - Utilize three text colors varying from dark to light for better contrast. |
|    | - Apply big font gaps for better contrast between items. |
|    | - Check contrast ratio for accessibility. |
| 2. | **Shades of Black** |
|    | - Avoid creating multiple shades of black; use black with different opacities instead. |
| 3. | **Understanding Colors** |
|    | - Use addition and subtraction in HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) to create color variations. |
|    | - Keep the hue value constant and adjust saturation and brightness for variations. |
|    | - RGB and CMY can help create darker or lighter variations of the base color. |
| 4. | **Spacing for Separation** |
|    | - Use generous spacing between groups instead of just adding lines. |
|    | - The Law of Proximity states that objects near each other are grouped together. |
| 5. | **Color Separation for Rows** |
|    | - Use colors as separators between rows to aid readability and add visual interest. |
| 6. | **Multiply Blend for Text** |
|    | - Use multiply blend mode instead of drop shadows for text readability over dynamic image backgrounds. |
| 7. | **Line Length** |
|    | - Aim for 45–65 characters per line for optimal readability. |
|    | - Center align content to remove excessive white space. |
| 8. | **Component-Based Design** |
|    | - Avoid reinventing components; reuse existing designs to maintain consistency. |
| 9. | **Brand Colors as Accents** |
|    | - Use brand colors as accents rather than dominating the interface to maintain balance. |
| 10. | **Bullets in Margin** |
|     | - Position bullets, glyphs, or numbers in the margin for better list readability. |

# 7 Practical Tips for Cheating at Design

Improving your designs with tactics instead of talent. Every web developer inevitably runs into situations where they need to make visual design decisions, whether they like it or not.

Maybe the company you work for doesn’t have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on your own. Or maybe you’re hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site.

It’s easy to throw your hands up and say, “I’ll never be able to make this look good, I’m not an artist!” but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that don’t require a background in graphic design.

Here are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today:

1. **Use color and weight to create hierarchy instead of size**
   - A common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font size to control your hierarchy.
   - Instead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using color or font weight to do the same job.
   - Try and stick to two or three colors and two font weights for UI work.

2. **Don’t use grey text on colored backgrounds**
   - Making text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but it doesn’t look so great on colored backgrounds.
   - Choose a color that’s the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness until it looks right.

3. **Offset your shadows**
   - Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset.
   - It looks a lot more natural because it simulates a light source shining down from above.

4. **Use fewer borders**
   - When you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately reaching for a border.
   - Instead of borders, try using box shadows, two different background colors, or extra spacing to create distinction between elements.

5. **Don’t blow up icons that are meant to be small**
   - Icons drawn at 16–24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size.
   - If small icons are all you’ve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color.

6. **Use accent borders to add color to a bland design**
   - Add colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a bit bland.
   - It doesn’t take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle to your UI.

7. **Not every button needs a background color**
   - Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Communicate their place in the hierarchy through button design.
   - Save the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually is the primary action in the interface.

7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI (Part 1)
Lutz Dieckhöfer
Lutz Dieckhöfer
 1.0.0 | 8. Feb. 2019, 08:55 |  26 Minuten und 20 Sekunden | 8
 

A non-artsy guide to creating beautiful apps and sites
Introduction 
OK, first things first. This guide is not for everyone. Who is this guide for?

Developers who want to be able to design their own good-looking UI in a pinch.
UX designers who want their portfolio to look better than a Pentagon PowerPoint. Or UX designers who know they can sell an awesome UX better in a pretty UI package.
If you went to art school or consider yourself a UI designer already, you will likely find this guide some combination of a.) boring, b.) wrong, and c.) irritating. That’s fine. All your criticisms are right. Close the tab, move along.

Let me tell you what you’ll find in this guide.

First, I was a UX designer with no UI skills. I love designing UX, but I wasn’t doing it for long before I realized there were a bunch of good reasons to learn how to make an interface look nice:

My portfolio looked like crap, reflecting poorly on my work and thought process
My UX consulting clients would rather buy someone’s skills if their expertise extended to more than just sketching boxes and arrows
Did I want to work for an early-stage startup at some point? Best to be a sweeper
I had my excuses. I don’t know crap about aesthetics. I majored in engineering – it’s almost a badge of pride to build something that looks awful.

“I majored in engineering — it’s almost a badge of
pride to build something that looks awful.”
In the end, I learned the aesthetics of apps the same way I’ve learned any creative endeavor: cold, hard analysis. And shameless copying of what works. I’ve worked 10 hours on a UI project and billed for 1. The other 9 were the wild flailing of learning. Desperately searching Google and Pinterest and Dribbble for something to copy from.

These “rules” are the lessons from those hours.

So word to the nerds: if I’m any good at designing UI now, it’s because I’ve analyzed stuff — not because I came out the chute with an intuitive understanding of beauty and balance.

This article is not theory. This article is pure application. You won’t see anything about golden ratios. I don’t even mention color theory. Only what I’ve learned from being bad and then deliberately practicing.

Think of it this way: Judo was developed based on centuries of Japanese martial and philosophical traditions. You take judo lessons, and in addition to fighting, you’ll hear a lot about energy and flow and harmony. That sort of stuff.

Krav Maga, on the other hand, was invented by some tough Jews who were fighting Nazis in the streets of 1930s Czechoslovakia. There is no art to it. In Krav Maga lessons, you learn how to stab someone’s eye with a pen and book it.

This is the Krav Maga of screens.

The Rules 
Here they are:

Light comes from the sky
Black and white first
Double your whitespace
Learn the methods of overlaying text on images (see Part 2)
Make text pop — and un-pop (see Part 2)
Only use good fonts (see Part 2)
Steal like an artist (see Part 2)
Let’s get to it.

Rule 1: Light Comes From the Sky
Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we’re looking at.

This is perhaps the most important non-obvious thing to learn about UI design: light comes from the sky. Light comes from the sky so frequently and consistently that for it to come from below actually looks freaky.

 

WoooOOOooo
When light comes from the sky, it illuminates the tops of things and casts shadows below them. The tops of stuff are lighter, the bottoms are darker.

You wouldn’t think of people’s lower eyelids as being particularly shaded, but shine some light on those suckers and all of a sudden it’s demon girl at your front door.

Well, the same is true for UI. Just as we have little shadows on all the undersides of all our facial features, there are shadows on the undersides of tons of UI elements. Our screens are flat, but we’ve invested a great amount of art into making so many elements on them appear be 3-D.

 

My favorite part of this image is the poker finger in the lower-right.
Take buttons. Even with this relatively “flat” button, there are still a handful of light-related details:

The unpushed button (top) has a darkened bottom edge. Sun don’t shine there, son.
The unpushed button is slightly brighter at the top than at the bottom. This is because it imitates a slightly curved surface. Just as how you’d need to tilt a mirror held in front of you up to see the sun in it, surfaces that are tilted up reflect a biiiiit more of the sun’s light towards you.
The unpushed button casts a subtle shadow – perhaps easier to see in the magnified section.
The pushed button, while still darker at the bottom than at the top, is overall darker – this is because it’s at the plane of the screen and the sun can’t hit it as easily. One could argue that all the pushed buttons we see in real life are darker too, because our hands are blocking the light.
That was just a button, and yet there are these 4 little light effects present. That’s the lesson here. Now we just apply it to everything.

 

iOS 6 is old news, but it makes a good case study in light behavior.
Here is a pair of iOS 6 settings — “Do Not Disturb” and “Notifications”. NBD, right? But look how many light effects are going on with them.

The top lip of the inset control panel casts a small shadow
The “ON” slider track is also immediately set in a bit
The “ON” slider track is concave and the bottom reflects more light
The icons are set out a bit. See the bright border around the top of them? This represents a surface perpendicular to the light source, hence receiving a lot of light, hence bouncing a lot of light into your eyes.
The divider notch is shadowed where angled away from the sun and vice versa
 

A close-up of a divider notch, from an old concept of mine.
Elements that are generally inset:

Text input fields
Pressed buttons
Slider tracks
Radio button (unselected)
Checkboxes
Elements that are generally outset:

Buttons (unpressed)
Slider buttons
Dropdown controls
Cards
The button part of a selected radio button
Popups
Now that you know, you’ll notice it everywhere. You’re welcome, kid.

Wait, what about flat design, Erik?
We’re 5 years into a trend of “flat design”, which is, well, exactly what it sounds like. Flat design is a visual style in which the elements lack simulated indentations or protrusions. They’re just lines and shapes of solid color.

 

I love clean and simple as much as the next guy, but I don’t think this is a long-term trend here. The subtle simulation of 3-D in our interfaces seems far too intuitive to give up entirely.

Five years ago, I predicted we’d see a rise of “flatty design”, and, at least of 2019, that’s where we are – elements of flat’s clean appearance, with a dusting of shadows to help us figure out what we’re looking at.

 

We live in a golden age, here in this happy medium between difficult-to-get-right skeuomorphism and usability-challenged flat design. Flatty is still clean, still simple, but you’ll have some shadows and cues for what to tap/slide/click.

 

OS X Yosemite— flatty, not flat.
Or, another example of flatty design: Google’s Material Design language.

 

This is the sort of thing I see sticking around.

It uses subtle real-world cues to convey information. Key word,subtle.

You can’t say it doesn’t imitate the real-world, but it’s also not the web of 2006. There are no textures, no sheens, and the only gradients are purely decorative.

Flatty is the way of the future, I think. Flat? Psh, just a thing of the past.

 

That flat design looks so hot right now!
Rule 2: Black and White First
Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements.

UX designers are really into designing “mobile-first” these days. That means you think about how pages and interactions work on a phone before imagining them on your zillion-pixel Retina monitor.

That sort of constraint is great. It clarifies thinking. You start with the harder problem (usable app on a teeny-weeny screen), then adopt the solution to the easier problem (usable app on a large screen).

Well here’s another similar constraint: design black and white first. Start with the harder problem of making the app beautiful and usable in every way, but without the aid of color. Add color last, and even then, only with purpose.

 

Haraldur Thorleifsson’s grayscale wireframes look as good as lesser designer’s finished sites.
This is a reliable and easy way to keep apps looking “clean” and “simple”. Having too many colors in too many places is a really easy way to screw up clean/simple. B&WF forces you to focus on things like spacing, sizes, and layout first. And those are the primary concerns of a clean and simple design.

 

 

 

Classy grayscale.
There are some cases where B&WF isn’t as useful. Designs that have a strong specific attitude— “sporty”, “flashy”, “cartoony”, etc. — need a designer who can use color extremely well. But most apps don’t have a specific attitude except clean and simple. Those that do are admittedly much harder to design.

 

 

Flashy and vibrant designs by Julien Renvoye (left) and Cosmin Capitanu (right). Harder than it looks.
For all the rest, there’s B&WF.

Step 2: How to add color
The simplest color to add is one color.

 

Adding one color to a grayscale site draws the eye simply and effectively.

 

You can also take it one step up. Grayscale + two colors, or grayscale + multiple colors of a single hue.

Color codes in practice — i.e. wait, what’s a hue?
The web by and large talks about color as RGB hex codes. It’s most useful to ignore those. RGB is not a good framework for coloring designs. Much more useful is HSB (which is synonymous with HSV, and similar to HSL).
HSB is better than RGB because it fits with the way we think about color naturally, and you can predict how changes to the HSB values will affect the color you’re looking at.
If this is news to you, here’s a good primer on HSB colors.
 

Single-hue gold theme from Smashing Magazine.
 

Single-hue blue theme from Smashing Magazine.
By modifying the saturation and brightness of a single hue, you can generate multiple colors— darks, lights, backgrounds, accents, eye-catchers— but it’s not overwhelming on the eye.

Using multiple colors from one or two base hues is the most reliable way to accentuate and neutralize elements without making the design messy.

 

Countdown timer by Kerem Suer
In my experience, adjusting your theme color to fit the use-cases your UI calls for is the most important skill in using color, and I’ve written a practical guide to it here.

A few other notes on color
Color is the most complicated area of visual design. And while a lot of stuff on color is obtuse and not practical for finishing the design in front of you, I’ve seen some really good stuff out there.

A small toolbox:

Learn UI Design. Shameless plug: this is a course I’ve created, and it contains 3 hours of video about designing with color (and over 20 hours of total videos on UI design topics). Check it out at learnui.design.
Color in UI Design: A (Practical) Framework. If you liked this section, but want to hear more about color (as opposed to just black and white), this is your article. And guess who wrote it!
Never Use Black (Ian Storm Taylor). Talks about how totally flat grays almost never appear in the real-world, and how saturating your shades of gray– especially your darker shades– adds a visual richness to your designs. Plus, saturated grays more closely mimic the real-world, which is its own virtue.
Adobe Color CC. An awesome tool for finding, modifying, and creating color schemes.
Dribbble search-by-color. Another awesome way to find what works with a particular color. Talk about practical. If you already have one color decided, come look at what the world’s best designers are doing/matching with that color.
Rule 3: Double your whitespace 
To make UI that looks designed, add a lot of breathing room.

In Rule 2, I said that B&WF forces designers to think about spacing and layoutbefore considering color, and how that’s a good thing. Well, it’s time we talk about spacing and layout.

If you’ve coded HTML from scratch, you’re probably familiar with the way HTML is, by default, laid out on the page.

 

Basically, everything is smashed towards the top of the screen. The fonts are small; there’s absolutely no space between lines. There’s a biiit of space between paragraphs, but it isn’t much. The paragraphs just stretch on to the end of the page, whether that’s 100 px or 10,000 px.

Aesthetically speaking, that’s awful. If you want to make UI that looksdesigned, you need to add in a lot of breathing room.

Sometimes a ridiculous amount.

Whitespace, HTML, and CSS
If you, like me, are used to formatting with CSS, where the default is no whitespace, it’s time to untrain yourself of those bad habits. Start thinking of whitespace as the default— everything starts as whitespace, until you take it away by adding a page element.
Sound zen? I think it’s a big reason people still sketch this stuff out on paper.
Starting with a blank page means starting with nothing but whitespace. You think of margins and spacing right from the very beginning. Everything you draw is a conscious whitespace-removing decision.
Starting with a bunch of unstyled HTML means starting with content. Spacing is the afterthought. It has to be explicitly stated.
Here’s an illustrative music player concept by Piotr Kwiatkowski.

 

Pay particular attention to the menu on the left.

 

Left menu
The vertical space between the menu items is fully twice the height of the text itself. You’re looking at 12px font with just as much padding above and below it.

Or take a look at the list titles. There’s a 15px space between the word “PLAYLISTS” and its own underline. That’s more than the cap height of the font itself!And that’s to say nothing of the 25 pixels between the lists.

 

More space in the top nav bar. The text “Search all music” is 20% of the height of the bar. The icons are similarly proportioned.
The left sidebar shows generous spacing in between lines of text, and more.

Piotr was conscientious about putting in extra space here, and it paid off. While this is just a concept he put together for the fun of it (as far as I know), as far as aesthetics go, it’s beautiful enough to compete with the best music UIs out there.

Good, generous whitespace can make some of the messiest interfaces look inviting and simple— like forums.

 

Forum design concept by Matt Sisto
Or Wikipedia.

 

Wikipedia design concept by Aurélien Salomon
You can find plenty of argument that, say, the Wikipedia redesign leaves out key functionality to using the site. But you can’t say it’s not a good way to learn!

Put space between your lines.

Put space between your elements.

Put space between your groups of elements.

Analyze what works.

OK, that wraps up Part 1. Thanks for sticking around!

In Part 2, I’ll be talking about the last 4 rules:

4. Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
5. Make text pop— and un-pop
6. Only use good fonts
7. Steal like an artist
If you learned something useful in Part 1, read Part 2.

Still can’t get enough? Introducing… Learn UI Design
I’ve been plugging away to create the single most comprehensive online video course for learning the practical skills of interface design.

 

Learn UI Design covers all kinds of topics:

Color. Picking good colors, adjusting them for different purposes in your interface, developing a palette, fixing clashing colors, and more.
Typography. Choosing fonts, styling text, pairing fonts, and more.
Fundamentals of design. Spacing, alignment, grids, layout, lighting, shadows, and more.
User interface elements. Form controls (like buttons and text boxes), icons, imagery (like photography and illustrations), tables and lists (hugely important for mobile app design), and more.
Here’s an idea of how much content there is. The topics you’ve already heard about — lighting, use of gray, and spacing — each have their own videos, totaling 1 hr, 52 min.

There is a ton of content in this course: 20+ hours of video in 40+ video lessons.

 

In almost every video, you’ll watch me design in Sketch. This is important. I’m not teaching some theoretical framework here. Instead, everything I show you is the tips, tricks, and frameworks I use to design interfaces every day. Think of it as watching over my shoulder as I teach you everything I know.

For example, in the “Gray” video (yes: 27 minutes all about using a single color), I start by showing you a practical technique to make your grays match your theme colors, no matter what those colors are. Then I do another demo to show off gray’s versatility, explaining ways in which its subtlety is actually a strength. This includes some tips that took me years to notice.

 

Finally, I explain why gray is the classiest color, and used by so many luxury and fashion brands. Then I explain the homework for the lesson and wrap up. By the end, we’ve done 3 live demos, explained a few key tricks for how to add gray to your designs, and looked at 10 well-designed real-world examples (including 1 designed by me).

Here’s what folks are saying about Learn UI Design:

“Learn UI Design is like learning how to fly a plane by actually sitting in the cockpit with the pilot — Erik is constantly designing/redesigning real-world examples right in front of you, explaining why X is good or bad, and how to go about making it even better.”
 — Mudassir Ali, Frontend Engineer, Canva
“Learn UI Design’s straightforward approach, illustrated with real-life examples and tutorials, was extremely helpful and eye-opening. I would highly recommend this course for UX designers wanting to add UI design to their toolkit.”
 — Sarah Kim, UX Design Lead
“Erik’s pragmatic approach to design has taught me infinitely more than what reading any design books ever did! Away with the books, and one more video please.”
 — Anders Nysom, Freelance Developer
If you’re a dev, UX designer, or PM, and want to add visual design to your skillset, this course is tailor-made for you. Hop on over to learnui.design for more.

 

Oh, and finally: I have a Design Newsletter to which I intentionally send out very few but very high-value design articles (like the one above). If you want to see stuff like this every month (or 6) in your inbox (basically all of it unpublished anywhere else), you should take a moment and sign up:

7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI  (Part 2)
Lutz Dieckhöfer
Lutz Dieckhöfer
 1.0.0 | 8. Feb. 2019, 08:52 |  30 Minuten und 31 Sekunden | 11

 
A guide to visual aesthetics, written by a nerd
This is the second part in a two-part series. You should read the first part first.

We’re talking about rules for designing clean and simple UI without needing to attend art school in order to do so.

Here are the rules:

Light comes from the sky (see Part 1)
Black and white first (see Part 1)
Double your whitespace (see Part 1)
Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
Make text pop— and un-pop
Only use good fonts
Steal like an artist
Rule 4: Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
There are only a few ways of reliably and beautifully overlaying text on images. Here are five— and a bonus method.

If you want to be a good UI designer, you’ll have to learn how to put text over images in an appealing way. This is something that every good UI designer does well and something every bad UI designer does piss-poorly— or just doesn’t do, in which case you’ll have a huge leg up after reading this section!

Method 0: Apply text directly to image
I hesitate to even include this, but it is technically possible to put text directly on an image and have it look OK.

 

Otter Surfboards. Hip and Instagrammy, but a bit difficult to read.
There are all sorts of problems and caveats with this method:

The image should be dark, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges
The text has to be white— I dare you to find a counter-example that’s clean and simple. Seriously. Just one.
Test it at every screen/window size to make sure it’s legible
Got all those? Great. Now never change the text or the image, and you should be good to go.

I don’t think I’ve ever used text directly on top of an image for any professional project, and it’s really mentioned here as a sort of “control” method. That being said, it’s possible to do to really cool effect— but be careful.

 

From Aquatilis.tv
Method 1: Overlay the whole image
Perhaps the easiest method to put text on an image is to overlay the image. If the original image isn’t dark enough, you can overlay the whole thing with translucent black.

Here’s a trendy splash image with a dark overlay.

 

Upstart website has a 35% opacity black filter.
If you hop into dev tools and remove the overlay, you’ll see that the original image was too bright and had too much contrast for the text to be legible. But with a dark overlay, no problem!

This method also works great for thumbnails or small images.

 

Thumbnails from charity:water site
And while a black overlay is simplest and most versatile, you can certainly find colored overlays as well.

 

Method 2: Text-in-a-box 
This is dead simple and very reliable. Whip up a mildly-transparent black rectangle and lather on some white text. If the overlay is opaque enough, you can have just about any image underneath and the text will still be totally legible.

 

Modern Honolulu iPhone Concept by Miguel Oliva Márquez
You can also throw in some color — but, as always, be judicious.

 

Now in pink. By Mark Conlan
Method 3: Blur the image
A surprisingly good way for making overlaid text legible is to blur part of the underlying image.

 

Copious blur overlays in Snapguide. Note the blurred areas are also darkened.
Apple has really made background blurring a thing, though it was in Windows first (go figure).

 

 

You can also use the out-of-focus area of a photo as the blur. But beware— this method is not as dynamic. If your image ever changes, make sure the text is always over the blurry bits.

 

Teehan + Lax
I mean, just try to read the subheader below.

 

For the love of everything good in this world, how did this get approved?
Method 4: Floor fade
The floor fade is when you have an image that subtly fades towards black at the bottom, and then there’s white text written over it. This is an ingenious method, and I have no idea who did it before Medium, but that’s where I first noticed it.

 

To the casual observer, it appears that these Medium collections are displayed by plastering some white text over an image— but in response to that, I say false! There’s ever-so-subtle a gradient from the middle (black at 0% opacity) to the bottom (black at, ehhhhh maybe ‘bout 20% opacity).

Difficult to see, but definitely there, and definitely improving legibility.

Also notice that the Medium collection thumbnails use a slight text shadow to further increase legibility. Those guys are good!
The net effect is Medium can layer just about any text on any image and have a readable result.
Oh, and another thing — why does the image fade black at the bottom? For the answer to that, see Rule 1 — light always comes from the top. To look most natural to our eye, the image has to be slightly darker at the bottom, just like everything else we ever see.

Advanced move: mix the blur with the floor flade… introducing The Floor Blur.

 

The “floor blur” on SnapGuide. Look mom, no overlay!
Bonus Method: Scrim
How does the Elastica blog have a readable headline on top of a dynamic image every single time? The images are:

Not particularly dark
Kind of contrast-y
Yet it’s difficult to describe why the text is so legible. Take a look:

 

 

Answer: the scrim.

A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it’s also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

If we browser zoom out on the Elastica blog, we can more clearly see what’s going on.

 

There is a gradiated-opacity box around the “145,000 Salesforce Users Come out to Celebrate…” headline. It’s easier to notice against the solid blue background than against the contrast-y photos above it.

This is probably the most subtle way of reliably overlaying text on images out there, and I haven’t seen it anywhere else (but it is pretty sneaky). Mark it down, though. You never know when you’ll need it.

Rule 5: Make text pop— and un-pop
Styling text to look beautiful and appropriate is often a matter of styling it in contrasting ways— for instance, larger but lighter.

In my opinion, one of the hardest parts of creating a beautiful UI is styling text— and it’s certainly not for unfamiliarity with the options. If you’ve made it through grade school, you’ve probably used every method of calling attention to or away from text that we see:

Size (bigger or smaller)
Color (greater contrast or lesser; bright colors draw the eye)
Font weight (bolder or thinner)
Capitalization (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case)
Italicization
Letter spacing (or— fancy term alert— tracking!)
Margins (technically not a property of the text itself, but can be used to draw attention, so it makes the list)
 

Solid use of color, capitalization, and spacing. By Jon Bell’s kid.
There are a few other options that are possible for drawing your attention, but not particularly used or recommended:

Underline. Underline means links nowadays, and it’s not worth trying to force it to mean anything else, if you ask me
Text background color. Not as common, but the 37signals website had this as link styling for a while, and IDEO animates it in on hover.
Strikethrough. Back off, you 90s CSS wizard, you!
In my personal experience, when I find a text element that I can’t seem to find the “right” styling for, it’s not because I forgot to try caps or a darker color— it’s because the best solution is often getting right a combo of “competing” properties.

Up-pop and down-pop
You can divide all the ways of styling text into two groups:

Styles that increase visibility of the text. Big, bold, capitalized, etc.
Styles that decrease visibility of the text. Small, less contrast, less margin, etc.
We’ll call those “up-pop” and “down-pop” styles, in honor of designers’ favorite adjective. We won’t call it “visual weight”, because that is boring.

 

Case study title from hugeinc.com
Lots of up-pop going on with the “Material Design” title. It’s big; it’s high-contrast; it’s very bold.

 

The items in this footer, on the other hand, are down-popped. They’re small, lower-contrast, and a less bold font-weight.

Now the important part.

Page titles are the only element to style all-out up-pop.
For everything else, you need up- and down-pop.
If a site element needs emphasis, apply both up-pop and down-pop styles. This will prevent things from being overwhelming, but allow different elements the visual weight they should have.

 

A balance of visual styles
The impeccably-designed Blu Homes website has some big titles, but the emphasized word is lowercase— too much emphasis would look overpowering.

 

These numbers on the Blu Homes site draw your eye with their size, color, and alignment— but notice that they’re simultaneously downplayed with a very light font-weight, and lower-contrast color than the dark gray.

The small labels below the numbers, however, while gray and small, are also uppercase and very bold.

It’s all about the balance.

 

contentsmagazine.com
Contents Magazine is a good case study in up/down-pop.

The article titles are basically the only non-italicized page elements. In this case, lack of italicization more effectively draws the eye (particularly in combination with the bold font-weight)
The author’s name is bolded in the byline — making it stand out from the normal-weight “by”
The small, low-contrast “ALREADY OUT” text stays out of the way — but with its uppercase type, generous letter-spacing, and large margins, you can see it the moment you look for it
Selected and hovered styles
Styling selected elements and hover effects are another round in the same game — but more difficult.

Usually, changing font-size, case, or font-weight will change how large of an area the text takes up, which can lead to seizing hover effects.

What does that leave you with?

Text color
Background color
Shadows
Underlining
Slight animations— raising, lowering, etc.
One solid option: try turning white elements colored, or turning colored elements white, but darkening the background behind them.

 

The selected icon goes from colored to white, but stays high-contrast against its background
I’ll leave you with this: styling text is hard.

But every time I’ve thought “Maybe this text just can’t look right”, I’ve been wrong. I just needed to get better. And to get better, I just had to keep trying.

So I offer you this bit of consolation: if it doesn’t look good, don’t worry– itcould if you were better. But hey, let’s keep on trying and make ourselves better.

Hey, PS: if you want to learn a ton more about styling text, check out Learn UI Design. I cover it in detail there.

Rule 6: Use Good Fonts
Some fonts are good. Use those fonts.

Note: There are no strategies or things to study in this section. I’m just going to list some nice free fonts for you to go download and use.

Sites with a very distinct personality can use very distinct fonts. But for most UI design, you just want something clean and simple. That’s right, buddy, put down the Wisdom Script.

Also, I’m only recommending free fonts. Why? This is a guide for folks who are learning. There’s more than enough out there at the zero-dollar price point. Let’s use it.

I recommend you download them all right now, and then go through your downloaded fonts as you start the visual design for your project.

 

The Font Book application “User” category is good for remembering what you downloaded (Mac only)
In no particular order:

1. Work Sans
Sometimes you’re designing something that needs a modern, clean font, but with juuuust a bit of fun. Work Sans fits the bill perfectly. Slightly quirky; totally underused.

 

You aren’t going to see this recommendation anywhere else (for a while), because Work Sans just came out with italics a month or two ago. The catch: you can’t get them on Google Fonts (yet). More on that below.

It’s wide letterforms means it works even at very small sizes — a great property for any mobile app typeface.

 

See it in the wild: designer Matt D. Smith’s website.

 

Get it at: Google Fonts (no italics), Font Squirrel (includes italics)

2. Roboto 
An incredible, clean, all-purpose font. While it is the default font of Android, it’s still underused (and free!) for iPhone and web apps.

 

Beautiful, works everywhere, and comes with a gadzillion weights.

 

See it in the wild: Google Maps

3. Montserrat 
I used to be hesitant to recommend Montserrat (it had no italics, weird kerning, and was awkwardly thick). But the project has stayed active and Montserrat has turned into an incredible font.

 

It’s probably best known for being the closest free alternative to the very popular (and well-designed) Proxima Nova.

 

Pro-tip: When choosing any font, it’s always best to take a look at uppercase, sentence-case, and the full range of weights. You never know when a slightly different setting will be just the style you want. Compare the two shots above — same exact font, two different feels.

4. Source Sans Pro
One thing I like about Source Sans is it makes a great choice when you’re tempted to go with the incredibly overused Open Sans or Lato. Resist the urge!

 

Source Sans has a lot of the same strengths as Open Sans or Lato — neutral character, just a touch of humanity (rather than cold, stark geometric letterforms), and it works great for user interfaces.

 

For easy pairing, check out its sisters: Source Serif and Source Code Pro.

Get it at: Google Fonts

5. IBM Plex Sans
Last year, IBM released its own typeface, Plex.

 

 

Oh yeah — and pairs easily with Plex Serif and Plex Mono.

Get it at: Google Fonts

6. Feather Icons
While many popular icon sets (ahem, Font Awesome) have overly rounded and bubbly shapes that don’t pair well with clean, simple design, Feather Icons is a hugely under-appreciated antidote.

 

The creator hasn’t packaged it as an icon font (yet 🤞), but someone put a font version up on Github that tracks the original set decently well (and if you’re only using 10 or 20 icons from the set, no sense loading the whole font anyways).

Get it at: SVG set, partial icon font

I’ll leave you with a few resources:

Beautiful Google web fonts. This is an awesome showcase of how good Google Fonts can look. I’ve returned to this simple page for inspiration at least a dozen times.
FontSquirrel. A collection of the best fonts available for commercial use, and totally free. Nice that someone’s putting together a good, free selection apart from Google Fonts.
Adobe Fonts. If you are on Adobe Creative Cloud (i.e. subscription Photoshop or Illustrator, etc.), then you have free access to a ton of professional fonts. Even better than what I recommended above: Proxima Nova, Adelle Sans, DIN, Freight Text, and more.
 

Learn UI Design. Looking for more great fonts? My user interface design course has a font recommendations listwith over 60 fantastic free (or free-through-Creative Cloud) fonts, covering all types of fonts (serifs, slabs, monospace, handwritten, etc.), and including notes on where each font works best.
Rule 7: Steal like an artist
The first time I sat down to try and design some app element— a button, a table, a chart, a popup, whatever— was the first time I realized how little I knew about how to make that element look good.

But as luck would have it, I haven’t had to invent any new UI elements yet. That means I can always see how others have done it and cherry-pick from the best.

But where should one cherry pick? Here are the resources I have found absolutely the most useful while designing for clients. Listed in descending order:

1. Dribbble 
This invite-only “show and tell for designers” site has bar-none the highest quality of UI work online. You can find great examples of almost anything here.

In fact, you can follow my work on dribbble here. Here are a few more people for you to follow as well:

Jamie Syke. Posting new UI basically every day. Top-notch stuff. Huge breadth of experience and designs. What can I say? Follow.
Balkan Brothers. It seems to be this weird dribbble truism that the closer the designer is to Russia, the more adept at colors they are. These Croat designers are fantastic with keeping flat interesting. Always great gradients, colors, and shadows.
Elegant Seagulls. If you’re ever thinking “man, how do I do something more interesting than a standard grid?”, browse a few of their shots. There’s your answer.
Cosmin Capitanu. An awesome wildcard. He makes things that look crazy-futuristic without being garish. Really good with colors. He doesn’t really focus on UX though— which is also a criticism of dribbble at large.

2. Flat UI Pinboard
I haven’t the slightest idea who “warmarc” is, but his pinboard of phone UI had been ridiculously useful to me trying to find disparate examples of beautiful UI.

 

3. Pttrns 
A directory of mobile app screenshots. The nice thing about Pttrns is the whole site is organized by— wait for it— UX patterns. This makes it very nice to quickly research whatever piece of interface you’re currently working on, be it a login page, a user profile, search results, etc.

 

I’m a firm believer that every artist should be a parrot until they’re good at mimicking the best. Then go find your own style; invent the new trends.

In the meanwhile, let’s make like thieves.

And, in the spirit of this section, the title “Steal Like an Artist” was lifted from an eponymous book that I have not read, mostly because the title seems to sum up anything that the pages might contain.

Conclusion 
I wrote this because I would’ve loved to see this a short time ago. I hope it helps you. If you’re a UX designer, do a nice mockup after you’ve sketched the wireframes. If you’re a dev, take your next side project and make it look good. I don’t want UI to seem like it takes magical art school skills to do decently. Just observation, imitation, and recording what works.

Anyhow, this is just what I’ve learned so far, and I am always a beginner.

If you’re still with me, you’ve read two articles totaling over 5,000 words and seen scores of illustrations and screenshots. But I’m not dead yet, so it ain’t over.

 

If you liked this, check out Learn UI Design, a complete video course for developers, UX designers, and entrepreneurs who want to learn interface design. The content there is the same style of stuff you’ve read above — practical strategies and analysis, not the useless theory that dominates so much internet design writing.

And you should also hop on board my design newsletter for more writing like this (if you can stand it).
