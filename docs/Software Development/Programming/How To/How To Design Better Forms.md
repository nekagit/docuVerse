# Design Better Forms

## Common Mistakes Designers Make and How to Fix Them

Whether it is a signup flow, a multi-view stepper, or a monotonous data entry interface, forms are one of the most important components of digital product design. This article focuses on the common dos and don’ts of form design. Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and there are exceptions to every rule.

## Dos and Don'ts

| Dos and Don'ts | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Forms should be one column | Multiple columns disrupt a user's vertical momentum. |
| Top align labels | Users complete top-aligned labeled forms at a much higher rate than left-aligned labels. |
| Group labels with their inputs | Present the label and input close together to avoid confusion. |
| Avoid all caps | All caps text is more difficult to read and scan. |
| Show all selection options if under 6 | Placing options in a selector drop-down hides options and requires two clicks. |
| Resist using placeholder text as labels | Placeholder text as labels causes usability issues. |
| Place checkboxes (and radios) underneath each other for scannability | Placing checkboxes underneath each other allows easy scanning. |
| Make CTAs descriptive | A call to action should state the intent clearly. |
| Specify errors inline | Show the user where the error occurred and provide a reason. |
| Use inline validation after the user fills out the field | Don’t use inline validation while the user is typing unless it helps them. |
| Don’t hide basic helper text | Expose basic helper text wherever possible. |
| Differentiate primary from secondary actions | Clearly distinguish primary and secondary actions. |
| Use field length as an affordance | The length of the field affords the length of the answer. |
| Ditch the * and denote optional fields | Denote optional fields instead of using the * marker. |
| Group related information | Create logical groups to help users make sense of the form faster. |
| Why ask? | Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data. |
| Make it fun | Be conversational, funny, and engaging to increase completion rates. |
